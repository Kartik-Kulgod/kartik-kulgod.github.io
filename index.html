<h2>ABOUT</h2>
<p>
I'm an sophomore at BITS Pilani, KK Birla Goa Campus.
</p>
<p>
Yes, I study in Goa.
<br>
The calm pristine waters of the Arabian sea, the fairness of the white sand beaches, the exciting vibe of Goa all have moulded me into the multi-dimensional person that I am, with eyes looking at the orange hue of the sun setting in the horizon.
I love to travel and explore new destinations with classic rock music tingling my ears. I am an avid squash player and play regularly.
This is in addition to my underlying interests in robotics and computer electronics.
